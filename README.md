# Looking for an apartment.
The other day my friend asked me to help him with finding a new apartment.
Thatâ€™s how this script came into existence. 

The script finds links to the apartments according to your guidelines.

It works in Poland and supports websites such as:
* Otodom
* Olx

but it's fully ready to add more websites in future.

Your input should contain:
* Name of city
* Lower limit
* Upper limit
* District (this one can be omitted - just write none)

**Example**:
```
Script.py warszawa 1000 3000 praga
```


You can change size of buffer(1-500):
```python
searchAmount = ?
```

The Script also creates JSON file with last search results.
